                <p>Every year, as the axis of the earth tips from pointing the North Pole away from the sun to pointing the North Pole toward the sun, those who live in the north can feel a change in nature. As the axis tips, so does the light.</p>

                <p>When I was a child, my winters were filled with a comforting darkness. As the trees pulled inwards and let their leaves fall to the ground, the days grew shorter allowing the moon to take the role as primary light bringer. Then the snow would fall and not only the light but the <em>sound</em> of the world became subdued, softer, calmer.</p>

                <p>As an adult the darkness of winter still resides in me like a cool blanket gently padding down the edges of life. It is calming, and invites introspection and reflection.</p>
                <p>Thinking back on the days of my youth, one thing stands out above all else: To enjoy the darkness, you have to ease into it, like slowly submerging yourself in the ocean. The darkness has value, but it can only be harnessed if you let it sink in slowly. If the light is taken away too abruptly, a sense of wrongness is all you feel, but when it's allowed to seep in through the cracks and fill all the small voids in life, it can be exactly what you need to see the world as it is.</p>

                <p>On winter solstice, when the north is reaching as far away from the sun as it can handle, the day in Oslo can be counted on four strikes of the clock. The sun makes its journey across the sky, not above you, but along the horizon, and every minute sees a transition in light, first from darkness to light, then from light to darkness again.</p>
                <p>Photographers talk of the Magic Hour, the Blue Hour, that period of timewhen the light is just right and creates an almost supernatural reality. In Oslo in the depths of winter, that Magic Hour comes four-fold. It is a few meager moments in the day when the world wakes up and the thin rays of the winter sun lends some much needed warmth to those who venture outside to meet it.</p>
                <p>Four hours, in the scope of a day, is a meager blessing for those who love the light. From sunrise to sunset, there is only so much that can be done, and yearning for the brightness of summer when the night is as short and ephemeral as the day is in winter, can become almost too much to bear.</p>
                <p>In those hours it can be easy to forget that darkness brings its own rewards. In darkness we become closer with each other, our voices hushed, our focus strengthened. We can talk about important things or just enjoy the silence as the wind moves crystals of snow across rooftops and lawns outside. The light of summer is a blessing, and so is the darkness of winter. To enjoy one, you must also learn to enjoy the other.</p>

                <p>We were standing still as the day came to an end, watching our shadows slowly lenthen across the frozen lake. The minutes ticked by as the last vestiges of our human sundials fought to stay visible in the overwhelming gradients of dusk.</p>
                <p>I wanted desperately to see how long my shadow would get before it disappeared, but moving toward its farthest point would only move it farther away.</p>
                <p>The lake was covered in snow, light as the dusting of powdered sugar on a fine cake. The wind picked up grains and threw them across the flat landscape, transforming and transforming and transforming it endlessly. My shadow waning, I reached my hand to the sky to see how far it would go.</p>
                <p>It seemed infinite, my shadow. The sun a thin line on the horizon, the rays of light were coming in at such a shallow angle that for a second I was touching the end of the lake, the mountain a kilometer away. Then it vanished, indistinguishable from the blue blanket of dusk that covered everything.</p>
                <p>For a second, my shadow was infinite.</p>
